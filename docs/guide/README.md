## What is zircle-ui?

**Zircle-ui** is an experimental frontend library to develop [zoomable user interfaces (ZUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface). It is based on [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and Javascript and comes with a set of components to create unconventional UIs.

## Features

- **Zoomable UI/UX** Enjoy a different UI/UX with the built-in zoomable navigation.

- **Circles everywhere** Breaking away from the conventional UI with a circular UI Kit.

- **Responsive** zircle-ui works pretty well on mobile devices and big screens. 

- **Customizable themes** Aren't the integrated color themes enough? No problem, it is easy to create new ones.

- **Zero-conf routes** Using Vue-router? Let **zircle-ui** handles the routes for you.

## When to use zircle-ui?

You can try **zircle-ui** to develop a wide range of applications, such as: dashboards, health/fitness trackers, IOT hubs or controllers, contact management, information and entertainment, interactive menus, etc.

In general, using **zircle-ui** should be fine if your application is highly interactive and you need to intuitively view and control information without loosing the user’s attention. 

## About zircle-ui
**zircle-ui** is the first [Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) I've made and it was possible thanks to the Open Source community, specially the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) community. 

**Zircle-ui** intends to promote a different approach in the universe of UIs. My main motivation is believing there is room for a new UI/UX not constrained to grid layouts or to squared shapes. 

**Zircle-ui** was inspired by the idea underneath some really awesome projects and articles like [prezi](https://www.prezi.com), [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), [tizen](https://www.tizen.org/), [zoomooz](http://jaukia.github.io/zoomooz/), [creativebloq's article](https://www.creativebloq.com/create-zoomable-user-interface-css-transforms-9114269), [google maps](http://maps.google.com), [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io) among others.
