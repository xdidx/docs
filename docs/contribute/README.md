First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing to **zircle-ui**. 🙏 

A lot of things could be improved and enriched with you collaboration no matter if you are a experienced developer or not. Below you will find just some guidelines for inspiration.

## Documentation
You can write, translate and improve the zircle’s documentation. Each page has a link to its source code, so you can easily edite and send a PR if you find a typo or something is not clear enough.

## Showcases and examples
Let the community know about you! Send me a [DM at @zircle_ui](https://twitter.com/zircle_ui) with your project link.

## Design
Glad to hear suggestions to improve the look and feel, zircle’s usability and its consistence.

## Coding
Find an open issue to tackle. New features are welcome!

### Inform an Issue
- **What issues can I inform?**

Besides informing a **bug**, you can **propose features, ideas, etc**. 

You can also open an issue if find something in the **documentation** is not clear enough. 

- **How to inform?**

Just try to explain **what happens** and **what is expected to happen** . Also, it would very useful to provide **a way to reproduce the issue** (JSFiddle, CodePen, CodeSandbox or provide a GitHub repo).

### Pull a request
Reference your PR to a related issue and provide a description of the changes proposed.

#### Guidelines

- The `master` branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- Work in the `src` folder and **DO NOT** checkin `dist` in the commits.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

- Make sure `npm test` passes.

- If adding new feature:
  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

### Development Setup

```bash
