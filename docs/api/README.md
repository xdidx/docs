The API es divided en three sections:

## [Main components](/api/z-canvas.html)
This section show the zircle's components exposed to the developer.

## [Child components](/api/z-view-manager.html)
This components work inside the main components.

## [State management](/api/public-api.html)
It is explained how to use the **zircle-ui state management**. When **zircle-ui** is [installed](/guide/getting-started.html) you have access to `$zircle` and the `actions` of the **zircle-ui state management**. A few of them are **public** and a lot are internal but usefull if you want to contribute or understand how **zircle-ui** works under the hood.
