# z-spot

## Description
<img :src="$withBase('/z-spot.png')" style="clear: right; margin-top: 20px; float:right" width="250px"/>

By default this component allows to zoom-in to a new view. In other words is a zoomable component to go to another view. Inside a `z-spot` you can nest other `z-spot`. Currently, [z-list](/api/z-list.html) is not available for `z-spot`  

### Zoom-in to a new view 
By default, `z-spot` is made to perform a zoom transition to another view. You need to use the property `to-view` indicating the name of the view you want to go. Also, is it possible to pass params that work with or without vue-router.

If you want to point a view to go, simply use `to-view` as `string` with the view name (it is not case sensitive). In case, you need to pass some params it is necesary to use an `object` in `to-view` as follows:

```js
to-view: "{ 
	name: 'device', 
	params: { 
		key: value,
		key: value
	}
}"
```

Then, in the target view **device** you can retrieve those params using [**$zircle.getParams()**](/api/public-api.html#getparams-definition) or [**$route.params**](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#the-route-object) if you [use vue-router](/guide/using-vue-router.html).

### Using programmatic navigation

In certain occasions you may need to perfom a programmatic navigation to zoom-in to a new view. Something similiar to [vue-router programmatic navigation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html)

Since **zircle-ui v.1.1.0** it's possible thanks to `toView` action (a sintax sugar of `setView`).

Regarding its usage you have two possible options. **One**, you can point the name of your defined view. In those cases the next view will appear in the center of the screen, because it doesn't have an initial `z-spot` to take the starting position as reference.

``` js
export default {
  /* ... */
    this.$zircle.toView('home')  
  /* ... */
}
```

**Two**, in case you want a new view appears from a specific `z-spot` position you'll need to define an object as follows:

``` js
export default {
  /* ... */
    this.$zircle.toView({
      to: 'name of the new view' // string. Required,
      fromSpot: reference-of-the-z-spot // Optional,
      params: { your params } // object. Optional
    })  
  /* ... */
}
```
- **to** is the name a the new view you want to navigate. You need to write the name of your defined view (e.g: 'home').
- **fromSpot** is the reference of the `z-spot` from which the new view will appear. To obtain the `z-spot`position reference you should use Vue [**ref / $refs**](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#ref). 

For instance:

``` vue
<template>
	<z-view>
		<z-spot slot="extension" ref="about" />
	</z-view>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  /* ... */
    this.$zircle.toView({
      to: 'about',
      fromSpot: this.$refs.about
    })  
  /* ... */
}
</script>
```

- **params** are optional. In case you want to pass params along with the new view, you should obtain them from the `z-spot` from which the new view will appear. In this specific case you can create a new attribute (e.g: colors) and then call it with [**$attrs**](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#vm-attrs).


For instance:

``` vue
<template>
	<z-view>
		<z-spot slot="extension" ref="about" colors="{white: '#ffffff', black: '#000000'}"/>
	</z-view>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  /* ... */
    this.$zircle.toView({
      to: 'about',
      fromSpot: this.$refs.about,
      params: this.$refs.about.$attrs.colors
    })  
  /* ... */
}
</script>
```



### Positioning
`z-spot` is positionated according its parent component (a `z-view`or a `z-spot`). Having that in mind, you need to use two properties: `angle` and `distance`.

To specify an `angle`, put any value between 0 and 360 degrees (degree could also be a negative number). See the diagram provided.

<img :src="$withBase('/angles.png')" style="margin-top: 20px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;"/>

The `distance` is a numeric value that represent the percentage of distance from the parent component. By default the `z-spot` has the 100% of distance. This means that the center of the `z-spot` is placed exactly in the tangent of the parent component. 

### Modifying the size
By default the diameter of the `z-spot` is `medium`. To change it, simply use the property `size` with any of the following values: 
- `xxl`, 
- `xl`, 
- `l` or `large`, 
- `m` or `medium`, 
- `s` or `small`, 
- `xs`, 
- `xxs`

### z-spot as button
This component can mutate its default behaviour to run as `button`. To enabled it set the property `button` as `true`.

In addition, you should add a [vue event](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html) when `button` is pressed.

### z-spot as knob

As happens with `button`, `z-spot`  can be a `knob`. As its name suggests this component displays an interactive circular progress bar with a circular handler. Usefull to create controls like volume, dimmers, etc.

To enabled it set the property `knob` as `true` and provide its initial value using the property `:qty.sync`. By default the `z-knob` has a range of 0-100 and show the current value in its label. 

```html
<z-spot
	knob
	:qty.sync="knobValue" >
</z-spot>
```
```vue
...
data () {
	return {
	  knobValue: 78
	}
}
...
```


You may need to customize the knob values: range values, unit displayed and where to show the current value. In that case, you can pass an `object`.

Here you have to pay atention at [v-bind.sync](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html#sync-Modifier) which is a vue property that allows us to pass and object using two-ways communication.

As [Vue indicates](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html#sync-Modifier) you can't use `v-bind.sync` with a literal object, such as `v-bind.sync=”{ qty: 24, unit: '˚C', min: 18, max: 32 }”`, you need to use an object data.

```html
<z-spot
	knob
	v-bind.sync= "temperature" >
</z-spot>
```

```js
...
data () {
	return {
	  temperature: {qty: 24, unit: '˚C', min: 18, max: 32}
	}
}
...
```

- **qty** pass a numerical value
- **unit** pass a string with the unit format
- **min** set the min value range
- **max** set the max value range
- **pos** positionate the knob label `inside`the z-spot container or `outside` it

**See this codepen:**
- [Example using knob with `qty:sync`and `v-bind.sync`](https://codepen.io/zircle/pen/EeBXQO)

### Organize your content
As happens with `z-view`, in a `z-spot` you can place different kind of contents. However media is not available.

#### slot.default
Tipically, the content you put inside a `z-spot` will be catched by a default Vue slot. In case the content is larger than the view container, it will be hidden. 

#### slot.extension
This slot allows to nest other **zircle-ui** components. If you want to add just one element add the slot name in the element. In case you need to add more elementes, you can create a wrap element with the slot name.

#### property imagePath
In case you want to add an image background `z-view` offers two options: the **`slot.image`** or the property **`imagePath`**.

#### property.label
Finally, it is possible to add a label to `z-spot` that could be positionated in the top, left, right or botton of the `z-spot`. When you use the property **`label`** the default position is the bottom of the `z-spot`. 

#### property.labelPos
If you want put the label in a different place, use the property **`labelPos`** with your prefered value: 'top', 'left', 'bottom', 'right'


### Content layers

OYou can see a diagram that shows how the content is placed. The `slot.image` is on the bottom, then the `slot.default`, and the `slot.extension`. 

<img :src="$withBase('/z-spot-layers.png')" style="margin-top: 20px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;"/>

### Slider
`z-spot` has a child component named `z-slider` that allow to show a circular progress bar around its perimeter. You need to set `true` the property `slider` and use the property `progress` with a value. 

### Caveats
- Currently, `z-spot` doesn't have `slot.media` so is not possible to add rich media (however you can put rich media using `slot.default`). 

- Also, if the content is larger than the `z-spot` container, it won't be scrollable. 

- Finally, you can't nest a `z-list` component inside a `z-spot`.

- The idea behind `z-spot` is that it should be a component to perform a transition to another view that by design doesn't have any of the above caveats. Having said that, all this limitations may be overcome in further releases.

::: tip
`z-spot` is the viewport of the next view. So, when you design a view and include a `z-spot` maybe is good to provide some hints of what it will see next.

## Usage

```html
<z-spot
  :angle="45"
  :distance="140"
  size="large"
  to-view="bar">
</z-spot>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default value | Required | Description
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `toView` | String, Object | undefined | False | This works as a link. When refered to a view (e.g: 'home') it zooms to home's view. If the view is not found a '404 view' will be generated.
| `distance` | Number | 100 | False | Is the distance from the center of the `z-view`. 100 means 100%.
| `angle` | Number | 0 | False | Is the angle of the `z-scale`. Accepts any number value positive or negative (ej: 345, -567)
| `size` | String | small | False | Represent the diameter of the `z-scale`component. Values: 'large', 'medium', 'small', 'extrasmall'
| `imagePath` | String | primary | False | Use this mixin to provide a path to an image.
| `label` | String | primary | False | This mixin provides a label which is situated at the bottom of the view. 
| `knob` | Boolean | False | No | When it is `true` a range knob is shown.
| `qty.sync` | Number | 0 | No | Qty works when knob is enabled giving its initial value
| `v-bind.sync` | Object |  | No | v-bind.sync enable a “two-way binding” for knob passing a defined object with this properties: **qty**, **unit**, **max**, **min**, **pos**.
| `slider` | Boolean | False | No | When it is `true` a circular slider is shown.
| `progress` | Number | 0 | No | progress works when slider is enabled giving its initial value.

## Slots

| Slot | Description
| :--- | :--- |
| `default` | Default Vue Slot. It is used to put any kind of content such as text, icons, etc. 
| `extension` | It is used when you nest other `z-spot` components.
